# Next.js 13 Runtime Error: Missing React.StrictMode

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 13 applications that arises when using functional components without explicitly wrapping them in `React.StrictMode`. The error manifests as an unexpected behavior or crash during runtime. 

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  Running this code in Next.js 13 will lead to the runtime error.  The error is because the functional component is missing `React.StrictMode` which can lead to unexpected behaviors or crashes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version. By wrapping the functional component in `React.StrictMode`, the error is resolved and the application runs without issues. This ensures proper handling of potential issues and improves the overall stability and predictability of the application.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a helpful guide for developers working with Next.js 13, highlighting a common pitfall and providing a straightforward solution. Remember to always consider wrapping functional components with React.StrictMode for optimal performance and stability.
